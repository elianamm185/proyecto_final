The present article provides an outline of opportunities and socio-techno-economic challenges of various biomass processing technologies. The biomass processing technologies were classified into three broad categories: thermochemical, chemical and biochemical. This review article presents an overview of two potential thermochemical conversion processes, gasification and fast pyrolysis, for direct conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. The article further provides a brief review of chemical conversion of triglycerides by transesterification with methanol for production of biodiesel. The highly productive microalgae as an abundant source of triglycerides for biodiesel and various other fuels products were also reviewed. The present article also provides an outline of various steps involved in biochemical conversion of carbohydrates to alcoholic bio-fuels, bio-ethanol and bio-butanols and conversion of nature's most abundant aromatic polymer, lignin, to value-added fuels and chemicals. Furthermore, an overview of production of hydrocarbon fuels through various biomass processing technologies such as hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides, biosynthetic pathways and aqueous phase catalysis in hydrocarbon biorefinery were highlighted. The present article additionally provides economic comparisons of various biomass conversion technologies.},

  abstract  = {The basidiomycete Gloeophyllum trabeum KU-41 can degrade Japanese cedar wood efficiently. To construct a strain better suited for biofuel production from Japanese cedar wood, we developed a gene transformation system for G. trabeum KU-41 using the hygromycin phosphotransferase-encoding gene (hpt) as a marker. The endogenous laccase candidate gene (Gtlcc3) was fused with the promoter of the G. trabeum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseencoding gene and co-transformed with the hpt-bearing pAH marker plasmid. We obtained 44 co-transformants, and identified co-transformant L#61, which showed the highest laccase activity among all the transformants. Moreover, strain L#61 was able to degrade lignin in Japanese cedar wood-containing medium, in contrast to wild-type G. trabeum KU-41 and to a typical white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. By using strain L#61, direct ethanol production from Japanese cedar wood was improved compared to wild type. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of the molecular breeding of lignin-degrading brown-rot fungus and direct ethanol production from softwoods by co-transformation with laccase overproduction constructs.},

Isolate 812 exhibited a high degree of lignin degradation at 34.7% while maintaining low holocellulose degradation at 2.1%, which performed better than the traditional white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium with 28.3% lignin degradation and 28.4% holocellulose degradation. Isolate 812 was identified as Fusarium moniliforme based on its 18S rDNA gene sequence and its morphological characteristics. Ligninolytic enzyme assay indicated that the fungus produced lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase during solid-state and liquid fermentation. Above results indicated that we had screened a F. moniliforme isolate with highly efficient delignification capability and very slight damage to holocellulose.

In addition, the topic is highly relevant in the field of plant pathogenic fungi as they degrade plant biomass to either gain access to the plant or as carbon source, resulting in significant crop losses. Finally, fungi are the main degraders of plant biomass in nature and as such have an essential role in the global carbon cycle and ecology in general.

Results exhibit conspicuous reduction in color and lignin of BL upto 913.46 Co-Pt and 531.45 mg l −1 , respectively. Reduction in chlorophenols up to 12 mg l −1 was recorded with highest release of chloride ions, i.e., 1290 mg l −1. Maximum enzyme activity for lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and laccase (LAC) was recorded as 5.06, 8.13, and 8.23 U ml −1 , respectively, during the treatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed successful immobilization of bacterial strains in porous structures of biomaterial.

This review compares the reliability and efficiency of the culture-dependent screening methods currently used for the isolation of ligninolytic prokaryotes. Isolated prokaryotes exhibiting lignin-degrading potential are presented according to their phylogenetic groups. With the development of bioinformatics, culture-independent techniques are emerging that allow larger-scale data mining for ligninolytic prokaryotic functions but today, these techniques still have some limits. In this work, two phylogenetic affiliations of isolated prokaryotes exhibiting ligninolytic potential and laccase-encoding prokaryotes were determined on the basis of 16S rDNA sequences, providing a comparative view of results obtained by the two types of screening techniques. The combination of laboratory culture and bioinformatics approaches is a promising way to explore lignin-degrading prokaryotes.},

The bacterial growth, chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction, secretion of ligninolytic enzymes and productions of low-molecular-weight compounds revealed that Comamonas sp. B-9 was able to degrade kraft lignin (KL). COD in KL-MSM reduced by 32% after 7 days of incubation. The maximum activities of manganese peroxidase (MnP) of 2903AE2 U l)1 and laccase (Lac) of 1250 U l)1 were observed at 4th and 6th day, respectively. The low-molecularweight compounds such as ethanediol, 3, 5-dimethyl-benzaldehyde and phenethyl alcohol were formed in the degradation of KL by Comamonas sp. B-9 based on GC-MS analysis. Conclusions: This study confirmed that Comamonas sp. B-9 could utilize KL as a sole carbon source and degrade KL to low-molecular-weight compounds. Significance and Impact of the Study: Comamonas sp. B-9 may be useful in the utilization and bioconversion of lignin and lignin-derived aromatic compounds in biotechnological applications. Meanwhile, using Comamonas sp.

  abstract  = {Lignin, the most abundant aromatic biopolymer on Earth, is extremely recalcitrant to degradation. By linking to both hemicellulose and cellulose, it creates a barrier to any solutions or enzymes and prevents the penetration of lignocellulolytic enzymes into the interior lignocellulosic structure. Some basidiomycetes white-rot fungi are able to degrade lignin efficiently using a combination of extracellular ligninolytic enzymes, organic acids, mediators and accessory enzymes. This review describes ligninolytic enzyme families produced by these fungi that are involved in wood decay processes, their molecular structures, biochemical properties and the mechanisms of action which render them attractive candidates in biotechnological applications. These enzymes include phenol oxidase (laccase) and heme peroxidases [lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and versatile peroxidase (VP)]. Accessory enzymes such as H2O2-generating oxidases and degradation mechanisms of plant cell-wall components in a nonenzymatic manner by production of free hydroxyl radicals (• OH) are also discussed.},

  abstract  = {Lignin degradation by white-rot fungi has received considerable attention as a means for reducing accumulation of lignocellulosic wastes in the environment. The stimulatory effect of surfactants on fungal lignocellulose bioconversion also has attracted wide interest. In this study the influence of dirhamnolipid biosurfactant on biodegradation of rice straw by Phanerochaete chrysosporium was investigated. It was shown that the biodelignification process of rice straw can be significantly enhanced by the presence of dirhamnolipid biosurfactant. In particular, the dirhamnolipid at the concentration of 0.007% increased the peak activity of lignin peroxidase (LiP) by 86% without affecting the manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity. The water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) contents in the straw substrates as well as the microbial growth and activity were effectively improved by dirhamnolipid, while the degradation rate of lignin increased by 54% with dirhamnolipid of 0.007%. Observed chemical structural and morphological changes showed that the straw substrates were delignified in the presence of dirhamnolipid with the formation of terrace-like fragments separated from the inner cellular fibers and the release of simple compounds. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that the dirhamnolipid addition induced a significant straw biodelignification which explained 22.1% (P = 0.013) of the variance.},
